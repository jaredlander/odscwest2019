# R Class

This is an empty repo to initialize an R project for class at by [ODSC
West 2019](https://staging5.odsc.com/training/portfolio/machine-learning-in-r-part-ii-2/).

Please **follow all instructions** to set up your environment for the
training.

# Install R and RStudio

This is just like installing any other program.

  - [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
  - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

# Getting the Repo

In order to get the most out of class you have to be working in this
project. There are three ways to get this project on your computer.

Choose **one of these methods**.

1.  Clone the repo using the command line
2.  Clone the repo using the RStudio GUI
3.  Use the [`{usethis}`](https://usethis.r-lib.org) package to download
    and unzip the repo

## Command Line

This assumes you have `git`
[installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\[1\]

Run this command in the command line or shell.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/jaredlander/odscwest2019.git
```

Then open the `odscwest2019.Rproj` file.

## RStudio Gui

This assumes you have `git`
[installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Click `File > New Project`.

Click `Version Control`.

Click `Git`.

Choose a folder in the `Create project as a subdirectory of` field.

Paste `https://github.com/jaredlander/odscwest2019`\[2\] in the
`Repository URL` field.

## `usethis` Package

Run these commands in the R console.

``` r
# install usethis package
install.packages('usethis')

# get the repo
usethis::use_course('https://github.com/jaredlander/odscwest2019/archive/master.zip')
```

Be sure to select the positive prompts such as `yes`, `yeah`, etc.

This will open the project in a new RStudio window.

After any of these methods you should have a new RStudio project called
`odscwest2019` or `odscwest2019-master`. You can see this in the top
right of RStudio (the name in the image may be different).

# Install Packages

Setting up all of the needed packages\[3\] will be handled by running
the following line of code in the R console.

``` r
source('prep/install_packages.r')
```

Answer `y` to any questions asked in the terminal.

If that fails, instaling `{tidyverse}` with the following code will
suffice to get started.

``` r
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

# Getting Data

The data are stored in a [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/jaredlander/coursedata) and can be downloaded
automatically with the following line of code, assuming all of the
packages installed successfully.

``` r
source('prep/download_data.r')
```

# All Done

That’s everything. You should now do all of your work for this class in
this project.

# Footnotes

1.  Can also be done with ssh instead of https.

2.  Or `git@github.com:nyhackr/cbs2019fall.git` for ssh.

3.  Linux users might need to install `libxml2-dev` and `zlib1g-dev`
