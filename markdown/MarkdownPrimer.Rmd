# First Section

We start a new section with a single hashtag. When I first started teaching this, people called it a "pound sign" but not anymore. Adding a third sentence to fulfill antiquated rules of grammar. Mark Twain would disagree. And so would JD Salinger. But I won't curse here.

To start a new paragraph we leave a blank line. White space is very important in markdown.

# Another Section

We start a new section by leaving a blank line and using a single hashtag. There is no need to close the previous section, just start a new one.

# Subsections are Helpful

We just started a new section to discuss syubsections.

## First Subsection

This subsection was started with two hashtags and is a sub to the preceeding section. No need to do anything to the enclosing section, just start a subsection.

## A Followup Subsection

To make another subsection, simply leave a blank line and use two hashtags. No need to close the prior subsection.

# Lists {#list-info}

First of all, notice that we exit subsection and section simply by creating a new section. We don't close anything.

## Unordered Lists

# Foramtting

Surrounding text with _single underscores an no spaces_ creates emphasized text. This happens to look italic^[We chan change this with CSS] with default settings.

Two __underscores__ will make strong text, which happens to look bold.

Three underscores makes for ___emphasized and strong___ text.

Backticks create `code style` text.

# Math

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
$$

We want to do $a + \bar{x}$ for our homework.

$$
\mathbb{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \dots & x_{1p} \\
1 & x_{21} & \dots & \dots & x_{2p}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY
$$

# R Time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

```{r simple-math}
1 + 1
2*3
```

Let's play with variables.

```{r variables}
x <- 3
x
```

Can we use `x` in subsequent chunks?

```{r use-variables}
# R comment in a chunk
x + 1
```

```{r show-options,results='hide'}
z <- 5
z*2
```

```{r show-z}
z
```

Let's print out a number out of nowhere.

```{r show-only-result,echo=FALSE}
y <- 7
y
```

Let's see the value of `y`: `r y`.

# Plots!

```{r diamond-scatter,message=FALSE,fig.cap='Scatterplot of price vs size and cut',cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + geom_point()
```

Wasn't that an awesome plot?

# Paths

```{r working-dir}
getwd()
dir()
here::here()
here::here('data', 'TomatoFirst.csv')
tomato <- readr::read_csv(here::here('data', 'TomatoFirst.csv'))
```

# Images

```{r display-image}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images', 'ProjectCorner.png'))
```

# Parameters

This report was generated for `r params$client`.


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images', sprintf('%s.png', params$client)))
```
